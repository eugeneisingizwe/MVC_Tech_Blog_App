# MVC_Tech_Blog_App
In this project I am building a CMS-STYLE blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers' posts. The app follows the MVC paradigm in it architectural structure, using Handlebars.js, Sequelize, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
